        <h1>Meet the Characters</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Mordecai – A laid-back blue jay who tries to be the responsible one but often gets dragged into chaos. Mordecai is the more responsible and level-headed of the two main characters. He often tries to do his job right but gets sidetracked by Rigby's antics. He enjoys playing video games, slacklining, and goofing off. Throughout the show, Mordecai has a crush on Margaret, a red robin who works at the local coffee shop.</li>
            <li>Rigby – Mordecai’s best friend, a mischievous and lazy raccoon who instigates much of the trouble. Rigby is lazy, immature, and always looking for shortcuts to avoid work. He’s prone to causing chaos but is deeply loyal to his best friend, Mordecai. Rigby's impulsive nature often leads to trouble, but his carefree attitude makes him a fun character.</li>
            <li>Benson – A gumball machine and the manager of the park, constantly frustrated with Mordecai and Rigby’s lack of work ethic. Benson is the park manager and Mordecai and Rigby’s boss. He is frequently frustrated with their slacking off and often explodes in anger when they don’t follow orders. Despite his strict demeanor, Benson does care about the park and his employees.</li>
            <li>Pops – A lollipop-headed, childlike and sweet man who lives in the park and is blissfully unaware of the strange things around him. Pops is an eccentric, childlike, and overly enthusiastic character. He often speaks in an old-fashioned, polite manner and has a positive outlook on everything. Pops is also incredibly kind-hearted and gentle, though sometimes naïve.</li>
            <li>Skips – An immortal yeti who serves as the park’s handyman, often helping the crew solve supernatural problems. Skips is the park's handyman and a source of wisdom. He is calm, level-headed, and often helps the group solve problems. Skips is also immortal, and his backstory and knowledge of the supernatural often play into the show’s plots.</li>
            <li>Muscle Man – A green-skinned, obnoxious park worker known for his bizarre humor. Muscle Man is loud, obnoxious, and often tells inappropriate "My mom!" jokes. Despite his crude behavior, he is a loyal friend to the other park employees. Muscle Man is also secretly sensitive and has a strong relationship with his girlfriend, Starla.</li>
            <li>Hi-Five Ghost – Muscle Man's quiet best friend, a ghost with a hand on his head. Hi-Five Ghost is Muscle Man’s best friend and sidekick. He’s much quieter and calmer than Muscle Man but often goes along with his antics. Hi-Five Ghost is friendly and laid-back.</li>
            <li>Margaret – A red robin who works at the local coffee shop, and Mordecai’s crush. Margaret is a smart, hardworking, and kind character who works as a barista at a local coffee shop. Mordecai has a long-standing crush on her, and their relationship is a key subplot throughout the series.</li>
            <li>Eileen – A shy and intelligent mole, and Rigby’s eventual girlfriend. Eileen is sweet, nerdy, and hardworking. She works alongside Margaret at the coffee shop and has a crush on Rigby. Over time, she becomes one of the group’s close friends and eventually dates Rigby. </li>
            <li>Starla - Muscle Man’s girlfriend and eventual wife, known for being equally loud and energetic. </li>
            <li>Mr. Maellard is Pops' father and the wealthy owner of the park. He is strict and stern, particularly towards Benson, but he deeply loves his son Pops.</li>
            <li>Thomas starts as an intern at the park and appears quiet and easygoing. However, later in the series, it’s revealed that he is a secret Russian spy, which adds a twist to his character arc.</li>
        </ul>
